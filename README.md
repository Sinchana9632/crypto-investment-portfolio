# Python Crypto Investment Manager

Python Crypto Investment Manager is a rule-based application developed to assist users in managing cryptocurrency investments in a structured and safer way. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and manual analysis of investments can be difficult and risky. This project addresses that problem by automating key investment decisions using predefined rules and basic mathematical calculations.

The system automatically allocates investment amounts across multiple crypto assets to ensure proper diversification. It evaluates investment risk by analyzing factors such as price volatility and exposure percentage. Based on historical price data, the project also estimates expected returns to give users an idea of potential performance.

All investment details, calculated risk scores, and return values are stored in a lightweight backend database for persistence and future analysis. The project also supports exporting investment data as CSV files, which can be easily opened in tools like Excel for reporting and record-keeping. In addition, alert notifications help users stay informed about important portfolio changes.

Overall, this project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to crypto investment management using rule-based logic, data storage, and automated reporting.
